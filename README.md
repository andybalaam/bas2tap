# BAS2TAP
A mirror of the BAS2TAP utility by Martijn van der Heide, ThunderWare Research Center to convert ZX Spectrum BASIC into .tap format.

This repo is a mirror of the source code that may be downloaded from http://www.worldofspectrum.org/utilities.html

It is provided in the hope that the code won't get lost if that site ever goes down.

I (Andy Balaam) added a Makefile for building on Linux, but otherwise have not made any changes.
